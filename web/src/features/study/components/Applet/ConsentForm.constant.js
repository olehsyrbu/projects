However, please note that any information collected up to the point of your withdrawal cannot be removed from the study.

This research is covered by a Certificate of Confidentiality from the National Institutes of Health. The researchers with this Certificate may not disclose or use information, documents, or biospecimens that may identify you in any federal, state, or local civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or other action, suit, or proceeding or be used as evidence, for example, if there is a court subpoena, unless you have consented for this use.
